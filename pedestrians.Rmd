## In Maryland, where is it dangerous to be a pedestrian?

This project started as an extension of a [project](http://cnsmaryland.org/2017/05/17/pedestrian-casualties-mount-in-maryland-town-as-officials-defer-action/) published by Capital News Service last spring about pedestrian deaths in Langley Park, Maryland. 

The reporting for that story pointed to failures by the State Highway Administration to properly address dangerous areas. We set out to find what other stretches of state roads see high numbers of pedestrians hit and how the agency has handled them.

## Our Data

We have data from the Maryland State Police detailing accidents. We're interested in how the Maryland State Highway Administration is handling pedestrian safety, so computer science major [Jake Gluck](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jake-gluck-890013122/) and I loaded, filtered and grouped the data in R, pulling only those accidents on state raods. We developed a clustering method in QGIS that helped us map where accidents have clustered together, now up on [Carto](https://jagluck.carto.com/builder/3907f54c-9f09-11e7-b60c-0e538bab2938/embed?state=%7B%22map%22%3A%7B%22ne%22%3A%5B39.011714588834074%2C-77.16659545898439%5D%2C%22sw%22%3A%5B39.41073305508498%2C-76.23825073242188%5D%2C%22center%22%3A%5B39.21150723299172%2C-76.70242309570312%5D%2C%22zoom%22%3A11%7D%7D).

## On To Reporting

We used our maps to identify the largest and most deadly clusters, picking three for further reporting. We went directly to the State Highway Administration, working to understand how the agency determines which areas get what improvements. We learned about their internal processes, and pulled documents that catalogued which stretches of state roads had been allocated money for pedestrian safety elements in the last few years.

The agency spend just 2 percent of its capital budget on pedestrian and bike improvements for fiscal years 2018 and 2019.

We've went to the local jurisdictions, too, and spoke with the local government advocates who deal with the agency on a regular basis, campaigning for their areas' interests. We found that the agency is often slow to act, and cites a big manual of requirements -- colloquially called the "Bible of traffic engineers" -- to reject requested improvements like crosswalks and traffic lights.

But our State Highway Administration contacts continued to tell us that most pedestrians are hit because of their own wrongdoing -- not the design of the roads or high speed limits.

We spent several afternoons on the streets of those local jurisdictions, talking to pedestrians who lived nearby and told us how dangerous the area felt. We got photos, video and GoPro footage, too, of the intersections and people jaywalking (since crosswalks are far apart).

We needed the perspective of pedestrians hit in these accidents. We compiled a list of names from accident reports and one of our databases, and scoured the social media and white pages sites for their contact information. When we found addresses, we sent letters and knocked on doors. Finally, we got the stories of two people whose relatives were killed in pedestrian accidents.

Our investigation is wrapping up: a story about people dying and the state working less-than-hard to prevent it. The story will be published by the end of December, so stay tuned.
