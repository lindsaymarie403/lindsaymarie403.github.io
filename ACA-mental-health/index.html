          <p>Celia Serkin’s daughter had just been released from psychiatric treatment in a hospital when she found herself back in a 24-hour crisis center.</p>
          <p>Her daughter needed medications to stay stable after release &mdash; but she couldn’t find an outpatient psychiatrist to treat her, Serkin said. The crisis center was the only option.</p>
          <p>“It doesn’t make sense to have a population that has insurance but can’t find care,” said Serkin, executive director of the Montgomery County Federation of Families for Children’s Mental Health.</p>
          <p>Over 200,000 people were added to the health insurance rolls in Maryland between 2013 and 2015, before and after the Affordable Care Act’s insurance exchanges opened, according to U.S. Census Bureau data, and the law mandated that plans on the individual and small group markets cover mental health services.</p>
          <p>But patients like Serkin’s daughter still have trouble seeing psychiatrists, who, doctors and advocates say, are overbooked, hard to find &mdash; and often not accepting insurance at all.</p>
          <br />
          <p><span class="section" id="one">More Patients, Fewer Psychiatrists</span></p>
          <p>Serkin’s family bought insurance on the Maryland Health Benefit Exchange, the state’s ACA-mandated insurance marketplace that began enrolling patients in October 2013.</p>
          <p>The ACA’s mandated mental health coverage built on the 2008 Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act, which required plans that cover mental health services do so to the same degree as other medical services.</p>

            <p>The Affordable Care Act increased insurance coverage for all income levels, especially for those at and below 400 percent of the poverty threshold. Combined with mandated coverage for mental health benefits, this means that more people can theoretically get psychiatric care.</p>

          <p>But a limited number of psychiatrists &mdash; only 55 percent nationwide &mdash; accepted private insurance between 2009 and 2010, according to a study in the Journal of the American Medical Association Psychiatry, the most recent study on the issue.</p>

            <p>Nearly half of psychiatrists didn't accept private insurance in the years leading up to the ACA, the most recent years data are available.

          <p>“It seems psychiatrists have enough people who are willing to pay straight out of pocket to keep them in business, so they don’t feel they need to expand to insurance to make ends meet,” said Dr. Elias Shaya, senior associate executive director for behavioral health services at MedStar Health.</p>
          <p>Paying out-of-pocket isn’t possible for many of those newly insured under the ACA, as nearly half &mdash; 42 percent &mdash; had incomes less than 200 percent of the poverty threshold, according to U.S. Census Bureau data.</p>
          <p>And the consequences for not getting psychiatric care can be deadly, Shaya said.</p>
          <p>For patients with urges to hurt themselves or others, timely and regular care is essential for personal and public safety, Shaya said.</p>
          <p>For others, untreated psychiatric conditions prevent normal engagement in society, he said.</p>
          <p>“Their disease is such that their entire life is destroyed,” Shaya said. “It deals with the most essential part of our being &mdash; our brain, our ability to think, our ability to decide &mdash; and when that’s taken away, people can’t get jobs and end up on the streets.”</p>
          <br/>
          <p><span class="section" id="two">Search and Struggle</span></p>
          <p>Many patients like Serkin’s daughter need immediate care when transitioning from psychiatric hospital stays to outpatient services, relying on medication to keep them stable, said Adrienne Ellis, former director of the Maryland Parity Project, which helps people with difficulty accessing mental health providers.</p>
          <p>Ellis said that during her tenure, the Parity Project fielded frequent calls from people on private insurance plans who were told they needed to wait four to six weeks for an appointment &mdash; often unreasonable given urgent mental distress.</p>
          <p>Ellis said many had called 10 to 15 providers, trying to find one who would even accept a new patient on their plan.</p>
          <p>A 2015 report from the Mental Health Association of Maryland confirms that finding a psychiatrist on a given insurance plan presents an onerous task.</p>
          <p>The organization studied the networks of psychiatrists for the four insurance carriers offering plans on the Maryland Health Connection, the website for Maryland’s health insurance marketplace.</p>
          <p>The carriers listed 1,154 psychiatrists total. Only 14 percent could be reached and were accepting new outpatients on the listed plan in the next 45 days.</p>
          <p>The information in the insurers’ directories are often wildly inaccurate, too: less than half of the psychiatrists listed could be reached with the contact information given, and another 19 percent weren’t even psychiatrists.</p>

            <p>Insurance companies don't update their network listings, meaning many psychiatrists listed are unreachable or not even psychiatrists. Others are not accepting the insurance listed or not taking new patients, making the task of makting a psychiatric appointment onerous.</p>

          <p>“Insurance companies have the fiduciary responsibility when they take my premium to ensure I can get that treatment, that I can find someone who can give it,” Shaya said.</p>
          <p>By leaving their network listings inaccurate, Shaya said, the insurance companies can claim they are providing patients with sufficient options for finding a psychiatrist without actually doing so.</p>
          <p>Often, psychiatrists choose not to accept insurance because the reimbursement levels the companies provide are relatively low, said Dr. Kim Jones-Fearing, a psychiatrist in Columbia, Maryland.</p>
          <p>“Psychiatrists are being driven out of business and no one’s doing anything about it. Patients are not getting care and no one’s doing anything about it,” Jones-Fearing said.</p>
          <p>The state sought to rectify the inadequate networks by enacting a law last year that requires carriers to meet certain standards for the physician directories they provide.</p>
          <p>But Jones-Fearing and Shaya said there’s a shortage of psychiatrists in general, as psychiatry is already one of the lowest-paying medical specialties.</p>

          <p>The psychiatrists the state does have are concentrated in Montgomery, Howard and Baltimore Counties and Baltimore City, according to the Maryland Board of Physicians’ roster.</p>
          <p>Those areas are generally more populated, but that leaves people in the counties with the largest percent change in insured populations between 2013 and 2015 &mdash; like Wicomico and Prince George’s Counties &mdash; without care within a manageable distance.</p>
          <p>And Somerset County, which has the highest poverty rate in the state, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, has zero psychiatrists.</p>
